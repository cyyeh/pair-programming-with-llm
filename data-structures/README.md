# Data Structures

- Let me explain the concept of Abstract Data Type (ADT):
  - An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a mathematical model or logical description of a data type that specifies:
    - The data that can be stored
    - The operations that can be performed on the data
    - The behavior of these operations
  - Key characteristics of ADT:
    - ABSTRACTION
      - Hides internal implementation details
      - Only shows what operations can be done, not how they're done
      - Focuses on WHAT rather than HOW
    - ENCAPSULATION
      - Bundles data and operations together
      - Protects data from direct external access
      - Provides interface through defined operations
    - Example of an ADT - Stack:
      - isEmpty()
      - push(item)
      - pop()
      - peek()
      - size()
    - Common ADT Examples:
      1. List
      2. Stack
      3. Queue
      4. Dictionary/Map
      5. Tree
      6. Graph
    - Benefits:
      - Separation of concerns
      - Code reusability
      - Maintainability
      - Implementation flexibility
    - The actual implementation of an ADT can vary (array-based, linked list-based, etc.), but the interface remains consistent.
